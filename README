st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of st is done by editing config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.


Useful keyboard shortcuts
-------------------------
* Ctrl+Shift+J to zoom out
* Ctrl+Shift+K to zoom in
* Ctrl+Shift+0 to reset zoom
* Ctrl+Shift+C to copy
* Ctrl+Shift+V to paste
* Select and middle mouse button also copies and pastes


If the del key does not work, you mat have to add 

    set enable-keypad on`

to /etc/inputrc or ~/.inputrc.
